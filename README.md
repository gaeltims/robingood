**Robin Good**

This is Ruby on Rails app I created with a team in eight days at the Le Wagon coding Bootcamp. It is a webapp that uses QR technology and crowd-sourcing to return lost items to their owners.

* Ruby 2.5.3

* You may need to run `yarn install` and `bundle install`

* This project uses a postgreSQL database, run `rails db:create` to create the database

* Database initialization - run `rails db:migrate`

Current User Stories:

* As a visitor, I can view the homepage

* As a user, I can create a profile

* As a user, I can edit my profile

* As a user, I can receive three free QR codes via mail

* As a user, I can add an item to my items list, and place the corresponding QR code on that item

* As a user, I can edit an item

* As a user, I can delete an item

* As a user, I can be notified/receive an email notification when my lost item has been found

* As a user, I can view the location of my lost item

* As a user, I can make a donation to a community cause when my item has been marked found

* As a user, I can order more QR codes

* As a user, I can delete my account

* As a finder (visitor who has found a lost item), I can scan a QR code

* As a finder I can send the details about the secure location I've left the lost item to the owner 

* As a finder, I can choose a community cause for the owner to donate to as a thank you for my good deed

I would like to add the following:

* An activity feed that shows items being returned in the community

* A counter that shows how much money has been raised for charity via the webapp
